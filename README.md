# Global Sass Variables

You can add global sass variables in a next js project easily, But it is not possible in a project witch is build with CRA. "glob-sass-var" runs with webpack dev server, so you can add your sass variables in custom webpack config and use it as global.

## Installation

1.Install the latest version of the package from npm:

```bash
npm i glob-sass-var
```
2.Update the existing calls to react-scripts in the scripts section of your package.json to use the webpack:

```bash
"scripts": {
-  "start": "react-scripts start"
+  "start": "webpack-dev-server"
-  "build": "react-scripts build"
+  "build": "webpack -w"
+  "glob-config": "glob-sass-var-cli"
}
```
3.Add this line to tsconfig.json

```bash
  "compilerOptions":
  {...
    "outDir": "./dist/",
    ...}
```

5.Run this command in terminal
```bash
   npm run glob-config
```
6.If you have babelrc and webpack config from before, "glob-sass-var" keep your config as a comment, so you can uncomment yours and add them again
